"348",4,"   One of the most self-actualizing experiences I've had in my life began when I was just 14 and told my parents I really wanted to fly airplanes.  My single mother was poor; my much older father was desperately poor.  However, they agreed to find the resources for $100/hour flight lessons IF - and my father emphasized that little word - if I first completed and passed flight (or ""ground"") school.  I agreed.  My parents paid the enrollment fee and I paid for the books from my modest savings.
   Then every week, twice a week, my mother drive me 30 miles one way to a small local airport in Selinsgrove, PA, where a 60-something, retired commercial pilot & no-nonsense flight instructor conducted the class.  There were 11 students, 10 of whom were adults.  I felt daunted at first, until I realized that, although they all had had previous flight lessons, I had a good head for meteorology and other technical aspects of flight.  
   We had two final exams and needed to obtain an 80% average to pass.  On my first exam, I got a 76.  My dad was not pleased; my mother said she knew I could ""ace"" the second exam if I studied harder.  I studied very hard for two days.  On the 2nd exam, I score exactly 84 points - an 80% average and passing score.  Only 3 of us passed the ground school course.
   For the next four years, my parents made sacrifices in order for me to get pilot lessons, complete solo and cross-country flights. Finally, I was a licensed (small airplane) private pilot.  I learned that I was, as that no-nonsense flight instructor who taught me to fly said, ""Tim, you're a natural, one of those guys who can land a plane on a dime.""  That stuck.  That gave me tremendous confidence. I had courage; I had the ""Wright stuff"".  ""Well, naturally,"" my father, a Korean War Marine Corp combat veteran, assessed.
